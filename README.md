# matmotion

Mobile Ad hoc networks node motion generation tool. It is based on the well-known motion pattern generation [Bonnmotion framework] (https://sys.cs.uos.de/bonnmotion/index.shtml)

## Requirements
**matmotion** has been tested on Matlab R2016b and Linux Unbuntu 18 LTS 64 bits
**bonmotion**: last version of this framework 3.0.1 is used here. Additionally, it is has been compiled with JRE 1.8.0_201. Depending on the platform and the used JRE you should compile again the framework. For that, remove ```bonnmotion-3.0.1``` folder, extract again ```bonnmotion-3.0.1.zip``` file, go inside the recent created folder and execute ```./install``` script.

## How to generate new node motion patterns with bonnmotion?
1. Go to ```setup/motion/``` 
2. Set up a new configuration file for one of the wide variety of motion patterns available (see official documentation on [Bonnmotion framework] (https://sys.cs.uos.de/bonnmotion/index.shtml)). **bonnmotion** framework uses \*.params to configure some parameters depending on the chosen pattern. You can see some examples for ```RandomWaypoint``` and ```RPGM``` movements by inspecting ```bonnmotion_RandomWaypoint.params``` and ```bonnmotion_RPGM.params``` files respectively.
3. Execute ```genmotion.sh``` script as following:
```
$ ./genmotion.sh 1 2 50UN_6AN RandomWaypoint
```
This example generates 2 different RandomWaypoint movement patterns sequence (repetitions) for 56 nodes that are saved on 50UN_6AN folder. Go inside it to see more details.

## Running a simulation with different repetitions
1. Be sure that the previous step has been done before continue.
2. **matmotion.m** engine set up. Next table shows correspondence between params you can foun in ```matmotion.m`` and ``bonnmotion_<movtype>.params```. We have been follow the generated example mentioned before.
